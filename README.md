# ETL-pipeline-example-in-Python

## *Introduction*
This example is part of [TowardsDev]([(https://towardsdev.com/]) Database, posted by a user called: Nazia Habib about how to create an ETL pipeline using Python. The goal of this example is to take data that might be unstructured or difficult to use or access and serve a source of clean, structured data. 
In this example we requested records from The Movie Database API. You can find the instructions for obtaining a key in this [link]((https://towardsdev.com/create-an-etl-pipeline-in-python-with-pandas-in-10-minutes-6be436483ec9]).

 
## *File Description*
Weâ€™ve created an ETL pipeline to built a structured schema from a list of JSON records and transformed our data into a clean, usable format.
